# Build a Reproducible Model Workflow - Exercises

This repo contains the code for demos, exercises, and exercise solutions.

This repository organizes the code by the lessons that they are used in. Each set of code is located in their respective lessons.

Please note that certain instructions for each exercise, as well as any relevant environment setup, are only provided within the Udacity classroom.

## Example:
All lesson 2 files are in `/lesson-2-data-exploration-and-preparation/`.

This directory contains: `demo`, `exercises`, with the `exercises` directory organized by the exercise number, and therein containing an exercise `README.md` file and `starter` and `solution` directories.
