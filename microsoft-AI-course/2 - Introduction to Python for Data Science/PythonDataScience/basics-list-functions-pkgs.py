#### SECTION ONE: Python Basics
####

### The Python Interface

# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)


### Any comments?
# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition works too
print(7 + 10)


### Python as a calculator

# Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)

# Modulo
print(18 % 7)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
investment = 100
interestRate = 1.1
for x in range(0,7) :
    investment  = investment * interestRate
print(investment)


### Variable Assignment

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)


### Calculations with variables

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10

# Calculate result
result = savings * factor ** 7

# Print out result
print (result)


### Other variable types

# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True


### Guess the type

### Operations with other types

# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings * factor

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print (doubledesc)


### Type conversion

# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + (str(result)) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)




####
#### SECTION TWO: List - data sctructure
####

### Create a list

# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas
areas = [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)


### Create list with different types

# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)


### List of lists

# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom", bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]
         ]
print(house)
print(type(house))

# Print out house

# Print out the type of house
print(house)


### Subset and conquer

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])

# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])

# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])


### Subset and calculate

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area = areas[3] + areas[7]

# Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)



### Slicing and dicing

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[0:6]

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[-4:]

# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(upstairs)
print(downstairs)



### Slicing and dicing (2)

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[:6]

# Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6:]

print (downstairs)
print(upstairs)


### Replace list elements

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Correct the bathroom area
areas[-1] = 10.50

# Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4] = "chill zone"



### Extend a list

# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage", 15.45]


### Inner workings of lists

# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = areas[:]

# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Print areas
print(areas)





####
#### SECTION THREE: Functions and Packages
####


### Familiar functions

# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))

# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)



### Multiple arguments

# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse = True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)


### String Methods

# string to experiment with: room
room = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on room: room_up
room_up = room.upper()
