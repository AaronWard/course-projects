# Deep-Learning-Explained
This repository contains the lab files for Microsoft course DAT236x: Deep Learning Explained

For each of the Modules 2-7, you must complete these labs and then answer the evaluation questions. 


# Module 2, Lab
## Getting Started with Keras

This lab gives a first look at using the Keras package to define, train and evaluate deep learning models with Keras. By the end of this lesson you will be able to work with basic feedforward architecture multi-layer neural nets. 

The details of feedforward models and regularization will be introduced in other lessons. For now, focus on becoming comfortable with using Keras so you are prepared for the rest of the labs in this course. 


# Module 3, Lab
## Introduction to Deep Neural Networks 

This lab introduces you to the basics of neural network architecture in the form of deep forward networks. This architecture is the quintessential deep neural net architecture. In this lab you will learn the following:

- Why is deep learning important and how it relates to representation, learning and inference.
- How a basic preceptron works.
- How to apply different types of loss functions. 
- Understand why nonlinear activation is important and why rectified linear units are a good choice.
- How back propagation works, and how you apply the chain rule of calculus to determine gradient. 
- Understand the architectural trade-off between depth and width in deep networks.


# Module 4, Lab
## Introduction to Regularization for Deep Neural Nets     

This lab introduces you to the principles of regularization required to successfully train deep neural networks. In this lesson you will:

1. Understand the need for regularization of complex machine learning models, particularly deep NNs. 
2. Know how to apply constraint-based regularization using the L1 and L2 norms.
3. Understand and apply the concept of data augmentation. 
4. Know how to apply dropout regularization. 
5. Understand and apply early stopping. 
6. Understand the advantages of various regularization methods and know when how to apply them in combination. 


# Module 5, Lab
## Optimization for Neural Network Training

Deep neural networks are trained by **learning** a set of weights. The optimal weights are learned by **minimizing the loss function** for the neural network. This minimization is performed using an **optimization algorithm**. Thus, optimization algorithms are an essential component in your neural network tool box.   

In this lab you will become familiar with the basic optimization algorithms used to train deep neural networks, along with their pitfalls. The nonlinear nature of neural networks leads to several serious problems with local gradients. 



# Module 6, Lab 
## Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

This lesson introduces you to a powerful neural network architecture, known as **convolutional neural networks**. Convolutional neural networks operate by **learning a set of filters**  or **convolution kernels**. Using a process, known as **convolution**, these filters extract a **feature map** from the raw data. The feature map is a **lower dimensional** map compared to the raw input features. 


# Module 7, Lab 
## Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks

In this lab you will explore **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**. Recurrent neural networks use a distinctive model which is suitable for sequence data. Sequence data can include human speech, natural language, and numerical time series. Natural language applications include machine translation and question response systems. RNNs can also be applied to multi-dimensional data. For example, RNNs are used to caption images.
